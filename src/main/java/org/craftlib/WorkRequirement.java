 * Typically the work has as parameters the precision needed, as well as the minimum force,
 * and possibly hardness of bits.

 * E.g. to nail things together one would need Hammering Work,
 * or to cut a wooden board some kind of Cutting Work (which could be provided by
 * a saw, axe, sword, lasercutter, waterjet cutter, or dragon teeth, each with different
 * precision and efficiency).
