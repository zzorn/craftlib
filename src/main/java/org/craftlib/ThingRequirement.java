 * E.g. a table created with boards and nails and beams will need nails that
 * are longer than the boards are thick, and boards and beams of some width and length.
 * The material of the beams and boards should be firm and cuttable.
 * The texture for the table will use the board and beam materials fot texturing,
 * possibly the nails as well.
